# The Halo MCC Improvement Project

Halo Studios have left the collection of classic halo games in a rather buggy state and seemingly have abandoned them.

The objective of this server is to bring a team together to help preserve these games and to hopefully polish them enough to be enjoyed for at least a few more years.

**Tasks include** (In order of priority):
  - Replacing the slow and bloated UE4 client with a bespoke custom one.
  - Adding a custom server browser to the new client with support for custom content.
  - Fixing bugs and possibly adding new features to improve the games.


Your welcome to join the team if you think you can help contribute to this project, hopefully good things will come out of this.

Of course there is a risk this project could be terminated due to the EULA but I feel like halo studios has abandoned this game to the point that they wont care anymore.
